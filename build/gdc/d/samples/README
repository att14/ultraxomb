What is the purpose of these samples?
-To be a small test bed for GDC on various platforms. 
-It provides small examples of what the D programming language can do.
-If all of the samples compile and run fine on your system, 
you should have a stable GDC installation.

How do I run all of the samples?
-In this directory(samples), there is a file called samples.sh. 
Run this from the command line/terminal. The output should be straightforward.

Where should I report the results?
-Depends. If everything goes well, then make a post of the D.GNU newsgroup, 
indicating OS and GCC version.
-If there are problems, post a bug to the project on bitbucket.org, 
and I'll do my best to fix it.

If you have a suggestion for a test that will help thorougly test parts of GDC,
make a post on the D.GNU newsgroup, and it will be considered to be a part of
the samples.
